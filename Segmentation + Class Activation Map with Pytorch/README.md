# Pytorch Segmentation + Class Activation Map

This includes the following four parts that you need to work through (check assignment3.ipynb):
1. FCN-32s

1.1 Implement FCN-32s

1.2 Train FCN-32s from scratch

1.3 Train FCN-32s with pretrained parameters

2. FCN-8s

2.1 Implement FCN-8s

2.2 Train FCN-8s with pretrained parameters

3. Answer the questions in the notebook

4. Implement CAM

The dataset can be downloaded by running the script provided in the compress file:

```
bash get_dataset.sh
```
